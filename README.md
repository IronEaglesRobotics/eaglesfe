## Downloading the Project

1. Install and setup *SourceTree* from https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
    * This is a graphical GUI client that makes managing your code a lot easier.
2. Clone the *master* branch of this *repository* within *Source Tree*.
    * In *Source Tree*, in by clicking the "Clone/New" button (or similar verbiage) and selecting "Clone from URL". 
    *  Use https://github.com/IronEaglesRobotics/eaglesfe.git as the URL for the repository.
    *  Store it on your computer anywhere you like. Call it 'eaglesfe'.
3. Once *Source Tree* is done downloading the repo, click on the button that says "Branch". 
    * Give your branch any name you like. 'dev-John_Smith' or something is just fine.
4. Install *Android Studio* from https://developer.android.com/studio/
5. Open *Android Studio* and select "Import project (Eclipse, ADT, Gradle, etc.)" at the window that opens.
    * Point it to the root parth where you stored the clone of the repo from step 2 above.
6. **Start sciencing!**
